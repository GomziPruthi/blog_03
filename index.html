            <p>Nobody likes needles. However, numerous common acute and chronic conditions require frequent blood draws large and small to monitor biomarkers important in tracking progress in cancer treatments, diabetes, and other conditions. Advances in low power wireless communications, as well as novel chemical sensing techniques employing both optical and electronic probes, are enabling the continuous, non-invasive monitoring of critical medical information.</p>

            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of billions of electronic devices, including low-power IoT sensors. With 5G providing adequate power, tiny antennas in IoT sensors can harvest energy from wireless signals, similar to automated tags powered by radio signals from toll stations.</p>

            <p>Conversational AI tools, while not new, have historically proved unsuccessful. They are placed third because to technological breakthroughs and lower licensing costs. Increased sales, automated customer support, employee self-service, and frictionless purchasing experiences are some of the advantages. Poorly built chatbots, losing trust, and inflexible platforms that cannot adapt to innovation are all risks.</p>

            <h2>What measures could make the use of AI more transparent and explainable to the public?</h2>

            <time>September 5,2023</time>
            <p>AI's opacity can be a problem, but it can also be a solution. Inherently transparent AI technologies can illuminate opaque ones. Machine learning, a powerful tool, is often used for classification tasks but has opaque mechanisms. To address transparency and explainability, we should move away from using a single-technology version of AI and instead use a full AI toolkit that includes concept-rich knowledge-based systems and data-driven algorithms. This approach can help progress towards the original definition of AI while addressing issues of explainability and transparency.</p>

            <p>Tech companies have been working on creating wearable devices that will replace smartphones in terms of convenience and capability. The AI pin, a tiny laser projector designed to be clipped to the front of a shirt, is a unique virtual assistant and communication device all in one. It can make and receive calls, connect to the internet, and answer a broad variety of questions. The pin is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip and runs a proprietary large language model powered by GPT-4, OpenAI's most powerful generative algorithm. It comes equipped with a microphone, a camera, and a bevy of sensors, allowing it to interact with the world, gather data, and answer queries. Humane's co-founders, Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, have been working on the AI pin, promising it will revolutionize our relationship with computing forever. The device is expected to be around $1,000.</p>
